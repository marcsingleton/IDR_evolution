NOTES
This script makes a few decisions about what exactly a best hit to both a polypeptide and a gene are. Regarding
polypeptides, since it is possible for there to be multiple hits to different segments of the sequence, the "best" is
taken as the HSP with the largest bitscore. However, all other HSPs from this hit are recorded. Proceeding from highest
to lowest bitscore, these HSPs are marked as disjoint if they do not overlap with any HSPs previously marked as
disjoint. Additionally other polypeptide hits are recorded if the strongest HSP in that hit exceeds the bitscore of
the strongest hit to a polypeptide that is not associated with the same gene as the best polypeptide hit. If there are
multiple HSPs with the same best bitscore, then they are both treated as the best hit. Overall, this means a single
polypeptide can records of multiple HSPs which in turn are part of multiple polypeptides which are in turn part of
multiple genes.

Regarding genes, a strict adherence to the top hit criterion would allow only polypeptide per gene. This can create
mutually exclusive sets of polypeptide hits within a single orthologous group, a more flexible strategy is allowing
multiple best hits within a gene. The most natural extension of the polypeptide criterion is choosing top hits ranked by
evalue until the parent gene of the polypeptide changes. Subsequent hits to the top gene are considered ambiguous and
ignored (similar to how subsequent hits to a polypeptide are ignored in the polypeptide case). This criterion will
exclude some polypeptides that are associated with the best gene, but since these are ranked lower than hits to
polypeptides in other genes, they should not be included since other stronger hits are discarded.
