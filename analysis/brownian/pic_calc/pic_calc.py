NOTES
The somewhat awkward zipping of the group and trees lists is due to a limitation of groupby and mp.Pool
    It is possible to filter groups with a built-in method, which is likely more efficient, but the filtration combines the data again, which would force a second round of grouping.
    Ideally, the code would pass the groups and the block_contrasts function would instantiate a new tree as needed.
        However, mp.Pool cannot parallelize functions which are not defined at initialization.
        Thus, I cannot create a block_contrasts factory function which can include the tree in the enclosing scope.
            The options are either to pass the tree as a argument or make block_contrasts dependent on the global environment.
