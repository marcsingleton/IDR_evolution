    """Find k-clique communities in graph using the percolation method.

    A k-clique community is the union of all cliques of size k that
    can be reached through adjacent (sharing k-1 nodes) k-cliques.

    This function is taken nearly verbatim from networkx with the minor
    change that it reports edges rather than nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    k : int
       Size of smallest clique

    cliques: list or generator
       Precomputed cliques (use networkx.find_cliques(G))

    Returns
    -------
    Yields sets of nodes, one for each k-clique community.

    """Find k-clique communities in graph using the percolation method.

    This method differs from the networkx version in two respects. The first is
    it returns edges rather than nodes. The second, and more important
    difference is that it does not exhaustively find edges in the percolation
    graph. Since in some cases all cliques are found relatively quickly, the
    bottleneck is calculating the C*(C-1)/2 overlaps between all cliques,
    particularly if the number of cliques, C, is large. Since joining a
    k-clique community only requires that a clique is connected to a community,
    this approach is needlessly expensive for large graphs.

    This method assumes the number of connected components is small and
    therefore progressively checks each subsequent clique against a list of
    currently known connected components. All components which have at least
    one clique with sufficient overlap with the current clique are merged. The
    search can start with an arbitrary clique as the first connected component.
    This implementation, however, first sorts them by the number of edges
    associated with each node in the clique which are also not a member of that
    clique. This begins the search with cliques whose nodes are highly
    connected to nodes outside of that clique and are thus likely to have
    sufficient overlap with other cliques. The order of cliques within
    components reflects the history of merges and thus will contain runs of
    sorted cliques but will not be sorted globally. Using a priority queue to
    ensure highly-connected cliques are checked first within each component
    could further increase performance.

    Additionally, cliques without overlap are inserted at the end of the list
    of connected components. This ensures highly connected components remain at
    the front of the list and are thus checked first.

    At worst, the algorithm checks every clique against every other clique,
    which is the same time complexity as the naive approach. (It does not store
    the edges of the percolation graph, however, yielding an advantage in terms
    of space complexity.) At best, there is one connected component and the
    cliques are sorted so the initial seed clique overlaps with all others. In
    this case the complexity is linear in the number of cliques.
